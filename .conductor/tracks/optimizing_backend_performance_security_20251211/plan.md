# Plan: Optimizing Backend Performance and Security

## Phase 1: Initial Assessment and Identification

- [ ] Task: Review backend codebase for potential performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] Task: Identify security vulnerabilities in authentication, authorization, and data handling.
- [ ] Task: Document findings in a comprehensive report.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Initial Assessment and Identification' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Task: Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
- [ ] Task: Optimize database queries and interactions.
- [ ] Task: Refactor inefficient code sections.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Performance Optimization' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Security Hardening

- [ ] Task: Implement input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints.
- [ ] Task: Enhance authentication and authorization checks.
- [ ] Task: Implement secure error handling and logging.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Security Hardening' (Protocol in workflow.md)
