## Decisions

### Language/Version

- **Decision**: Node.js with TypeScript for the backend, and React for the frontend.
- **Rationale**: This is a modern, popular, and effective stack for building web applications. TypeScript provides static typing for better code quality, and React is a powerful library for building user interfaces.
- **Alternatives considered**: Python/Django, Ruby on Rails.

### Primary Dependencies

- **Decision**: Express.js for the backend, and the official Firebase SDK for interacting with Firebase services.
- **Rationale**: Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. The Firebase SDK is the standard way to interact with Firebase.
- **Alternatives considered**: NestJS, Fastify.

### Testing

- **Decision**: Jest for backend testing and React Testing Library for frontend testing.
- **Rationale**: Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript, and React Testing Library is the recommended tool for testing React components.
- **Alternatives considered**: Mocha, Cypress.
